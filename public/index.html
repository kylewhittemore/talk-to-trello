    <br />
    <P>click the button to start the application listening</P>
    <p>everytime you pause in your speech, the application will render the speech to text</p>
    <p>if you say "new trello card" as a single result (as in, freshly after a result is rendered) it will start
    listening for a card name.</p>
    <p>Once you pause again, it will render the card name and start listening for the card description.</P>
    <p>Once the description has been captured, the app will post it to a trello board as a new card!</p>
    <p>PS, check out the console for updates on what is happening with the app and for the response data.</p>
